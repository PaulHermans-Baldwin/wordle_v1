####Instructions
Your task is to write a text-based wordle game. This means that you can not use color to represent all the letter.
Instead, you will have to figure out how to display "green" and "yellow" letters using just text.

#### Rules of Game
* User has up to 6 turns to guess the secret word.
* If their guess is not correct, then it will be encoded as follows:
** letters in the correct place are green.
** letters in the wrong place but that are in the word are yellow.
** letters not in the word are gray.

* User can only guess words that are in the dictionary.
* The dictionary will contain only words that are 5-letters long.

#### Notes
* To simplify the code, you should make a dictionary with 10 5-letter words in it.
* Pay attention to user interface! Make your game presentable and playable by any random student who passes by our room.
